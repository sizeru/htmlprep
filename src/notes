I'd recommend that this program come with an install script that
    - Creates the daemon user
    - Creates /var/log/rmc and sets the appropriate permissions
    - Sets the appropriate permissions for the daemon user

When running normally will just run as the current user. systemd will take care of running as daemon.

Instruction:
    This program will rely on user group permissions.

On the server proper, there should be multiple users and groups for fine grained access and security control.

GROUP: webmasters - individuals in this group will be allowed to edit the files in /var/www, var/rmc, /etc/rmc
USER: rmc-local - this user is responsible for running daemons which do not communicate with the internet. This user should not have ssh access. rw access to /var/log, /var/rmc, /etc/rmc
USER: rmc-origin - this user runs programs which serve content to an nginx reverse proxy.
