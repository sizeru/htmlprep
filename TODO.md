# TODO
- Implement getting in core library (this creates LIBRARY). A simple "get" request is enough for the MVP.
- Create SERVER version by creating daemon and CONFIG
- Create STANDALONE version by providing a command line interface
- Create CLIENT version somehow???

- Need to stop failed requests from panicking
- Need to enable comments in parsing

- Need to put a little more work into the TLS implementation.
