# This is an HTML Pre-Processor for rust.

## What's the use case?
Currently, simple text replacement and includes in HTML files.

## Give Me An Example?
Let's say that on your static website you have a navbar that is at the top of every page. You can design this navbar in a separate HTML file and include that HTML file in all of your pages. Then, when the design of this navbar changes, you only change one file, instead of every on your website.

## Why not just use PHP?
In simple words, your site might not be doing that much, so it may be simpler for you to simply pre-process all your html files in bulk before launching your website, similar to how CSS pre-processing is normally handled.
